#Pancake Sort

Pancake sort is a sorting algorithm that focuses on decreasing number of reversals instead of decreasing the number of comparisons which is done by traditional sorting techniques. 


It's called pancake sort as it seems like we are flipping pancakes with a spatula, thus, what we can do to sort an array is to use ***flip*** function.
